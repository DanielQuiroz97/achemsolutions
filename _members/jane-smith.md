## About me

Greetings! I'm a dedicated PhD candidate at the
[Cooperstone Lab](https://www.cooperstonelab.com)
within The Ohio State University, where my passion lies in the fascinating 
intersection of metabolomics and genomics. My doctoral journey revolves around
unraveling the genomic regions orchestrating the expression of phytochemicalsâ€”a
mission that fuels my curiosity and intellectual drive.

## Software development

My expertise extends beyond the lab bench. I'm an enthusiastic mass spectrometry
aficionado and a skilled software developer, and I've recently undertaken 
some exciting projects:

-   [MS2extract](https://cooperstonelab.github.io/MS2extract/): I've crafted
    an R package designed to construct in-house MS/MS libraries, 
    facilitating advanced mass spectrometry analyses.
-   [PhenolicsDB](https://cooperstonelab.github.io/PhenolicsDB/):
    I've created a specialized MS/MS database, dedicated to the
    intricate world of phenolic compounds.
-   [RGCxGC](https://danielquiroz97.github.io/RGCxGC/): My R package streamlines
    the end-to-end processing of GCxGC-MS data, simplifying complex data analysis.


## Data analysis

To delve into my work further, take a look at my repositories, where you'll
find examples of mass spectrometry data analysis, as well as my ventures into
microbiome analysis:

### Mass Spectrometry

-   [Apple phytochemicals](https://github.com/CooperstoneLab/apple_phytochemicals):
    Targeted peak integration of MS data of phytochemicals present in
    apples.
-   [Uruspatha sagittifolia metabolomics](https://github.com/IKIAM-NPL/U_sagittifolia_tubers): 
    Exploring the metabolome of a plant with the power of stoping snake venom.

    
### Microbiome

-   [Ornamental Floral microbiome](https://github.com/DanielQuiroz97/Floral_Microbiome):
    Metagenomics analysis of the rhizosphere of ornamental cultivars.
-   [Microbiome present in Cayambe glaciar](https://gitlab.com/ec.microbiome.proj/cayambe-microbiome-year-1):
    Here, we explored the microbiome present in a tropical glacier.
-   [Microbiome present in Sumaco stratovolcano](https://gitlab.com/ec.microbiome.proj/sumaco-microbiome-year-1):
    Here, we explored the microbiome present in a tropical sleeping volcano.


## Teaching and mentoring

Beyond my research, I'm deeply committed to the realms of teaching and
mentoring. I'm currently serving as a teaching assistant for the 
[DataViz in R](http://datavisualizing.netlify.app/), and I find great
fulfillment in guiding for the second time. Additionally,
I'm a mentor within the [Metabolomics Group](https://github.com/IKIAM-NPL) 
at Ikiam University, where I'm devoted to nurturing the next generation of
scientists.

In essence, my journey is a fusion of scientific exploration, software 
innovation, and the joy of passing on knowledge. If you share my passion 
for metabolomics, genomics, or data science, let's connect and embark on a 
journey of discovery together!
